=== Infinitives/partiviples vs cases

inf3-* and agnt-part seem like cases of the same -mA form.  Is this
always the case?  Would we want to get rid of the agent participle and
merge all inf3 forms into "inf3" and just add case endings?  (Limiting
to a restricted set of cases)

Same for inf2

Same for inf4
